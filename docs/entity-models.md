# Entity Models


zentity relies on objects called ***entity models*** to control the execution of entity resolution jobs.
Entity models serve three purposes:

1. They define how to match each of the [`"attributes"`](/#/docs/entity-models/specification) of the entity.
2. They define how attributes map to the fields of [`"indices"`](/#/docs/entity-models/specification) in Elasticsearch.
3. They define which combinations of [`"attributes"`](/#/docs/entity-models/specification) lead to resolution.
