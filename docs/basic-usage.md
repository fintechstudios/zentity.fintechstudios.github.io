## <a name="prerequisites"></a>Prerequisites

You must know how to use the Elasticsearch APIs before you can learn how to use
zentity.

Specifically you should know:

- [How to create indices](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/indices-create-index.html)
- [How to create index mappings](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/mapping.html)
- [How to create text analyzers](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/analysis.html)
- [How to index data](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/docs-index_.html)
- [How to search data using the Query DSL](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/query-dsl.html)

If you truly wish to master the most important aspects of Elasticsearch for
zentity, then I would recommend you take these training courses offered by
Elastic, the creators of Elasticsearch.

- [Elasticsearch Engineer I](https://www.elastic.co/training/elasticsearch-engineer-1)
- [Elasticsearch Engineer II](https://www.elastic.co/training/elasticsearch-engineer-2)
- [Improving Search with Text Analysis](https://www.elastic.co/training/specializations/elasticsearch-advanced-search/improving-search-with-text-analysis)
- [Improving Search with Synonyms](https://www.elastic.co/training/specializations/elasticsearch-advanced-search/improving-search-with-synonyms)

If you have some basic experience with Elasticsearch, then you are ready to
learn how to use zentity.


## <a name="how-to-use-zentity"></a>How to use zentity

Before we dive in, let's look at the typical usage of zentity at a high level.

You can think of zentity as three step process:

- Step 1. Index some data
- Step 2. Define an entity model
- Step 3. Resolve an entity

Let's break it down a bit more.


### <a name="index-data"></a>Step 1. Index some data

zentity operates on data that is indexed in **[Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/products/elasticsearch)**,
an open source search engine for real-time search and analytics at scale. The most common tools for indexing
documents in Elasticsearch are [Logstash](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/logstash/6.1/introduction.html) and
[Beats](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/libbeat/current/beats-reference.html). You can also index single
documents using the [Index API](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/guide/current/index-doc.html) or
[Bulk API](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/docs-bulk.html). You need to have
data in Elasticsearch before you can use zentity. You need to know how to use Elasticsearch, too.

Each tutorial in this series will give you sample data that you can use for practice.


### <a name="define-entity-model"></a>Step 2. Define an entity model

**[Entity models](/docs/entity-models)** are the most important constructs you need to learn about. zentity uses entity
models to construct queries, match attributes across disparate indices, and resolve entities.

An *entity model* defines the logic for resolving an *entity type* such as a person or organization. It defines the
attributes of the entity ([`"attributes"`](/docs/entity-models/specification#attributes)), the logic to match each attribute
([`"matchers"`](/docs/entity-models/specification#matchers)), the logic to resolve documents to an entity based on the
matching attributes ([`"resolvers"`](/docs/entity-models/specification#resolvers)), and the associations between attributes and matchers with
index fields ([`"indices"`](/docs/entity-models/specification#indices)). This is the step that demands the most thinking. You need to
think about what attributes constitute an entity type, what logic goes into matching each attribute, which attributes and
matchers map to which fields of which indices, and what combinations of matched attributes lead to resolution.

Luckily, all this thinking will pay off quickly, because entity models have two great features:

**Reusability**

Once you have an entity model you can use it everywhere. As you index new data sets with fields that map to familiar
attributes, you can include them in your entity resolution jobs. If you index data with new attributes that aren't
already in your model, you can simply update your model to support them.

**Flexibility**

You don't need to change your data to use an entity model. An entity model only controls the execution of queries.
So there's no risk in updating or experimenting with an entity model.


### <a name="submit-resolution-request"></a>Step 3. Resolve an entity

So you have some data and an entity model. Now you can resolve entities!

Once you have an [entity model](/docs/entity-models), you can use the **[Resolution API](/docs/rest-apis/resolution-api)** to run an
entity resolution job using some input.

**Example**

Run an entity resolution job using an indexed entity model called `person`.

```javascript
POST _zentity/resolution/person?pretty
{
  "attributes": {
    "name": [ "Alice Jones" ],
    "dob": [ "1984-01-01" ],
    "phone": [ "555-123-4567", "555-987-6543" ]
  }
}
```

Run an entity resolution job using an embeded entity model. This example uses three attributes, two resolvers, and two indices.

```javascript
POST _zentity/resolution?pretty
{
  "attributes": {
    "name": [ "Alice Jones" ],
    "dob": [ "1984-01-01" ],
    "phone": [ "555-123-4567", "555-987-6543" ]
  },
  "model": {
    "attributes": {
      "name": {
 Â  Â  Â  Â "type": "string"

      }
    },

          "name", "phone"

              "fuzziness": "{{ params.fuzziness }}"
            }
          }
        },
        "params": {
          "fuzziness": "auto"
        }
      },
      "standard": {
        "clause": {
          "match": {
            "{{ field }}": "{{ value }}"
          }
        }
      }
    },
    "indices": {
      "foo_index": {
        "fields": {
          "full_name": {
            "attribute": "name",
            "matcher": "fuzzy"
          },
          "full_name.phonetic": {
            "attribute": "name",
            "matcher": "standard"
          },
          "date_of_birth.keyword": {
            "attribute": "dob",
            "matcher": "exact"
          },
          "telephone.keyword": {
            "attribute": "phone",
            "matcher": "exact"
          }
        }
      },
      "bar_index": {
        "fields": {
          "nm": {
            "attribute": "name",
            "matcher": "fuzzy"
          },
          "db": {
            "attribute": "dob",
            "matcher": "standard"
          },
          "ph": {
            "attribute": "phone",
            "matcher": "standard"
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```
